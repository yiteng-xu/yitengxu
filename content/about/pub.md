  - title: A Unified Framework for Human-centric Point Cloud Video Understanding
    company: Accepted by CVPR2024
    company_url: ''
    company_logo: org-gc
    location: Seattle WA, USA
    date_start: '2024-06-17'
    date_end: '2024-06-21'
    description: |2-
        We propose a unified framework to make full use of the prior knowledge and explore the inherent features in the data itself for generalized human-centric point cloud video understanding.
  - title: Human-centric scene understanding for 3d large-scale scenarios
    company: Accepted by ICCV2023
    company_url: ''
    company_logo: org-gc
    location: Paris, France
    date_start: '2023-10-02'
    date_end: '2024-10-06'
    description: |2-
        We present a large-scale multi-modal dataset for human-centric scene understanding, dubbed HuCenLife, which is collected in diverse daily-life scenarios with rich and fine-grained annotations, with benchmarks in any 3D perception tasks, such as segmentation, detection, action recognition, etc.
  - title: Weakly Supervised 3D Multi-person Pose Estimation for Large-scale Scenes based on Monocular Camera and Single LiDAR
    company: Accepted by AAAI2023(Oral)
    company_url: ''
    company_logo: org-gc
    location: Washington, DC, USA
    date_start: '2023-02-07'
    date_end: '2023-02-14'
    description: |2-
        We propose a monocular camera and single LiDAR-based method for 3D multi-person pose estimation in large-scale scenes, with an effective fusion strategy to take advantage of multi-modal input data and make full use of temporal information to guide the network to learn natural and coherent human motions.
